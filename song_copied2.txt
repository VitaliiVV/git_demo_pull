do you remember standing on the broken fields
while crippled wings beating the sky
the harbingers of the war with their nature revialed 
and our chances flowing by...

if I can let the memory healed 
I will remember you with me on that field

when I thought that I fought this war alone
you were there, by my side on the frontline
when I though that I fought without a cause
you gave me a reason to try

Turn the page, I need to see something new
For now, my innocence is torn
We cannot linger on this stunted view
Like rabid dogs of war

I will let the memory heal
I remember you with me on that field
