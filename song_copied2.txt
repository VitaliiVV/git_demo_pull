do you remember standing on the broken fields
while crippled wings beating the sky
the harbingers of the war with their nature revialed 
and our chances flowing by...

if I can let the memory healed 
I will remember you with me on that field

when I thought that I fought this war alone
you were there, by my side on the frontline
when I though that I fought without a cause
you gave me a reason to try

Turn the page, I need to see something new
For now, my innocence is torn
We cannot linger on this stunted view
Like rabid dogs of war

I will let the memory heal
I remember you with me on that field

With no-one wearing their real face
It's a whiteout of emotion
And I've only got my brittle bones to break the fall

When the love in letters fade
It's like moving in slow motion
And we're already too late if we arrive at all

And then we're caught up in the arms race
An involuntary addiction
And we're shedding every value our mothers taught

So will you please show me your real face
Draw the line in the horizon
Cos I only need your name to call the reasons why I fought

When I thought that I fought this war alone...
